    <p>Learn how to deep-fry turkey for Thanksgiving without all the fuss. This deep-fried turkey recipe is simple — no injecting, no marinades, no complicated rubs. If you like a more traditional tasting turkey, this is the one for you!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ gallons peanut oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 (10 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large stockpot or turkey fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Make <br>
            sure the fryer is located outdoors in a safe area, preferably on dirt or pavement, <br>
            and far away from buildings, wooden decks, or other objects. Keep a fire <br>
            extinguisher handy, just in case.
        </li>

        <li>
            Ensure that the turkey is completely thawed. Cut any extra skin away from the <br>
            neck area and make sure neck hole is at least 1 inch in diameter. Pat the bird <br>
            completely dry with paper towels, then rub liberally with salt and pepper on <br>
            both the outside and the inside. Place turkey into a drain basket, neck-side first.
        </li>

        <li>
            Working slowly and carefully, gently lower the basket into the hot oil to <br>
            completely cover the turkey. Maintain the temperature of the oil at 350 degrees <br>
            F (175 degrees C), and cook turkey for 3 1/2 minutes per pound, about 35 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Carefully remove basket from oil, and drain turkey. Insert a meat thermometer <br>
            into the thickest part of the thigh; the internal temperature must be 180 degrees <br>
            F (80 degrees C). Allow to rest for 15 minutes before slicing.
        </li>
        
    </ol>
